<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will learn how to write an OS image to eMMC on the Gemstone development board.
</Tip>

The Gemstone operating system supports booting from eMMC in addition to SD cards. eMMC is a high-performance and reliable storage solution, 
offering faster data access and more robust physical construction compared to SD cards, making it the preferred choice for many applications.

To write core software (OS, firmware, bootloader, etc.) to eMMC, the Gemstone Imager provides an `Internal eMMC` storage device option. 
This ensures a smooth installation process on eMMC, enabling a faster and more durable working environment without dependency on an SD card.

This section provides detailed instructions on how to write an image to eMMC.

### 1. Writing an Image to eMMC
#### 1.1. Connect Gemstone to Your Computer

After connecting Gemstone via USB Type-C and Ethernet, also connect a USB-TTL UART converter to UART0.

<Warning>If you're using a Linux operating system, disable your computer's wired network connection before starting the writing process.</Warning>

#### 1.2. Starting the Writing Process

Follow the steps in the [Image Writing Process](/en/quickstart#1-2-image-writing-process) section of the [Quick Start](/en/quickstart) guide until 
the storage device selection step. Then, choose `Internal eMMC`.

Click `NEXT`, configure the necessary settings, and begin the eMMC image writing process.

#### 1.3. Connect to the Gemstone OS

After writing to eMMC, the system will automatically boot from eMMC. You can access the 
Gemstone OS via serial port or SSH.
