<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will learn how to write an image to the eMMC on the Gemstone development board.
</Tip>

The Gemstone operating system supports booting not only from an SD card but also from eMMC.
eMMC is a high-performance and reliable storage solution. Compared to an SD card, it offers faster data
access and a more robust physical structure, making it the preferred choice for many applications.

To write core software (such as the operating system, firmware, and bootloader) to the eMMC, Gemstone Imager
provides the `Internal eMMC` option as a storage device. This ensures a smooth installation on the eMMC,
delivering a faster and more durable working environment without relying on an SD card.

This section provides detailed instructions on how to write an image to the eMMC.

### 1.1. Connect Gemstone to Your Computer

After connecting the Gemstone board via USB Type-C and Ethernet, also connect a USB-TTL UART converter to UART0.

<Warning>
If you are using a Linux operating system, make sure to disable your computer's wired network connection before
starting the writing process.
</Warning>

### 1.2. Starting the Writing Process

Follow the steps in the [Quick Start](/en/quickstart) guide up to the
[Image Writing Process](/en/quickstart#1-2-image-writing-process) section, and select `Internal eMMC` as the storage device.

Then, click `NEXT`, configure the necessary settings, and begin writing the image to the eMMC.

### 1.3. Connect to the Gemstone Operating System

After the image writing process is complete, the system will boot from the eMMC. You can connect to the
Gemstone OS via serial port or SSH.
