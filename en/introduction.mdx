Gemstone development boards, composed of open-source software and hardware, are artificial intelligence-supported 
devices. They have optimized Real-Time Debian based GNU/Linux operating system which developed for use in
Teknofest competitions, including Manned and Unmanned Systems, IoT, Robotics, and similar applications.

These boards are being developed by the [Turkish Technology Team Foundation (T3)](https://t3vakfi.org/en/) for
competitors, students, and entrepreneurs.  

This documentation contains hardware specifications of the boards, installation guides, system customization
instructions, rich project examples, advanced ecosystem topics, and information about next-generation technologies.  

For feedback, suggestions, questions, etc., you can visit the [Community Forum](https://community.t3gemstone.org/).
