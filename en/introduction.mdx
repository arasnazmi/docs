[Gemstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone) boards are composed entirely of open-source software and hardware.
They are AI-supported hardware devices and optimized Debian-based GNU/Linux operating systems, developed for use
in TEKNOFEST competitions, including manned and unmanned systems, IoT, robotics, and similar fields. Developed by
the [Turkish Technology Team](https://t3vakfi.org/) for competitors, students, and entrepreneurs.

This document contains Hardware specifications of the boards, Instructions on how to perform installations,
Guidance on customizing the systems, A rich collection of project examples, Advanced ecosystem infrastructure
guides, and Information on next-generation technologies.
