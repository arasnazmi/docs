## Apache Nuttx

Pixhawk [Flight Controller](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/flight_controller/cubepilot_cube_orangeplus.html)
hardware mostly contains STM32 with Cortex-M architecture. The autopilot named PX4 runs on the real-time operating
system named Apache Nuttx and does not have support for Texas AM67a.

This project aims to run Apache Nuttx and PX4 on the Cortex-R5 cores found on T3-GEM-O1 development boards. The current
status and pending tasks are in the table below.
