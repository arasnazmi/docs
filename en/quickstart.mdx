Gemstone uses a Ubuntu/Debian-based operating system, with different variations available depending on project 
needs. While the [later sections](./distros/introduction) of the documentation explain which version to use for 
which projects, a summary is provided below:

* **Desktop:** An image containing applications such as a browser (Firefox), text editor, code development 
environment (VSCode), and video player (VLC), allowing the board to be used as a computer. This image is larger 
than the other two types and is mostly used for prototyping, testing, and development activities. 
(For robotics projects, the "Minimal" image is more suitable.)

* **Kiosk:** An image that does not include the applications or desktop environment found in the Desktop image, 
primarily used for touch panel purposes. (For example, the touch media control panel in Tesla vehicles or the 
control screen in passenger vehicles during Teknofest competitions.)

* **Minimal:** This image contains a real-time Linux kernel and is optimized for IoT, robotics, and autopilot 
applications. It is a powerful and deterministic structure suitable for embedded software system development projects.

#### 1.2.5. Select the storage device (SD card/eMMC)

After connecting your SD card and reader to your computer, the Gemstone Imager application will list the relevant 
device as shown in the screenshot below.

<Frame caption="SD card or eMMC selection">
  <img src="/images/gem-imager/d-select-storage.png" />
</Frame>

After completing all three options, click the **Next button** as shown below.

  <img src="/images/gem-imager/g-prepare.png" />
</Frame>

#### 1.2.6. Customize the system

After completing the above selections, clicking the Next button will automatically open the **System Customization** 
screen. This screen is used to set the board's login password and enable certain services to start automatically.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="General Settings">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gem-imager/e-setting-1.png" />
    </Frame>

    * Enter an 8-character password in the **Password** field on the screen. This password is for the "gemstone" 
      user account in the Linux operating system and will be required when accessing the board.

    * If you want your Gemstone board to connect to a Wi-Fi network after completing the image writing process 
      and powering it on, check the "Configure wireless LAN" option and enter the Wi-Fi network name and password.

        <Warning>Caution: Ensure you enter the correct Wi-Fi network name (Access Point Name) and password.</Warning>

    * Finally, check the **Set locale settings** option and select the keyboard language for the Gemstone board.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Services" >
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gem-imager/f-setting-2.png" />
    </Frame>

    * **Enable SSH:** (Secure Shell) This option is required for connecting to the board via Terminal over 
      Ethernet, as explained later in this section. For images like Minimal and Kiosk, which lack desktop 
      components, Ethernet/SSH or Serial Port/Console is often used.

    * **Enable VNC:** When using Desktop-type images, [t3-gem-vnc](https://github.com/t3gemstone/t3-gem-vnc) 
      allows you to access the board's desktop via a browser without needing a monitor, keyboard, or mouse by 
      connecting the board's Ethernet cable to your computer.

    * **Gadgets:** When you connect your Gemstone board to your computer via USB Type-C, this feature allows the 
      board to obtain a virtual IP without needing an Ethernet cable, create a serial port, and use the board's 
      disk (like the storage area that appears when you connect a mobile phone to your computer) as a storage area.

  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

After customization, click the **Save** button to proceed to the next step.

#### 1.2.7. Start the writing process

and set the Bootmode pins to "SD card" as explained in the next section.

<Frame caption="Todo: Insert the SD card">
  <img height="200" width="200" src="/images/under-construction.png" />
</Frame>

### 1.3. Bootmode Switch

<Tooltip tip="Boot mode change switch">Bootmode switch</Tooltip> is used to determine how and from where 
(which disk the operating system boots from) the system will start when power is first applied to the board, or 
for purposes such as <Tooltip tip="Debugging">Debug</Tooltip> during software development. 

The table and screenshot below list all Boot modes available on the Gemstone O1 development board.
This section explains the installation process for the SD card, while the 
[eMMC (embedded disk on the board) usage](./imager/emmc) will be covered in later sections.

The SD card is often preferred for quick testing and development activities due to its convenience, but data 
loss can occur in moving systems where vibration may occur. If you plan to use your the board on a moving platform, 
eMMC is a more suitable choice.

<Frame caption="Todo: Bootmode switch image">
  <img height="200" width="200" src="/images/under-construction.png" />
</Frame>

| Boot mode         | Image    | Description   |
| :---------------- | :------- | :----------   |
| SD card           |          |               |
| eMMC              |          |               |
| Network           |          |               |
| NULL              |          |               |

### 1.4. Connect the board to the computer

After connecting the USB Type-C and Ethernet cables from the package to your computer and the development board as 
shown in the photo below, you are ready to explore the board!

<Frame caption="Todo: Connecting the SD card and reader to the computer">
  <img height="200" width="200" src="/images/under-construction.png" />
</Frame>

# 2. Exploring Gemstone

The following steps are for using your Gemstone development board via your computer. (For example, connecting 
to your Gemstone board's desktop via a browser or performing operations via Serial Port/Terminal from the command 
line). If you have the option to connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, you can also explore the board using 
this method!

<Accordion title="What is a Terminal?">
  The Terminal or Console concept refers to the method of performing operations by writing code on the command 
  line (Command Line Interface) without a graphical interface, windows, or buttons. Examples include 
  **CMD, Powershell** on Windows operating systems or the **Terminal** application on Unix/POSIX-based 
  operating systems. An example screenshot is provided below.
  <Frame>
    <img height="600" width="800" src="/images/terminal-windows.png" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

After setup, you can determine whether the board has a network connection via the connected Ethernet and USB 
Type-C or Wi-Fi settings (as explained in the [Customize System](./quickstart#1-2-6-customize-the-system) section) by 
checking if the 
<Tooltip tip="If an IP address cannot be obtained, this LED will blink; if an IP address is obtained, it will stay lit continuously.">green LED 
stays lit continuously</Tooltip>.

<Frame caption="Todo: Connecting the SD card and reader to the computer">
  <img height="200" width="200" src="/images/under-construction.png" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Serial Port">
    Connect to the board using a USB TTL Serial converter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="VNC">
    Connect to the board via a browser (Firefox/Chrome).
  </Step>
  <Step title="SSH">
    Connect to the board via a Terminal/Console application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2.1. Serial Port

The USB TTL converter cable is mostly used to connect to the board via serial port when an Ethernet connection 
is unavailable. Normally, when you connect your Gemstone board to your computer via a USB Type-C cable, if the 
"Gadgets" option under Services in the [Customize System](./quickstart#1-2-6-customize-the-system) section is 
checked, you can connect via serial port without needing a TTL cable. However, if an unexpected issue arises 
during development and these features do not work, you can still connect to the board using a USB TTL cable.

An advantage of this method is that it allows you to view the console outputs of U-Boot, the preloader (Bootloader) 
on Gemstone boards. While network initialization must complete before outputs appear when connecting over Ethernet, 
outputs are visible from the start when using TTL.

#### 2.1.1. Terminal/Console Application

For Terminal/Console operations, you can use [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) on Windows, Gnome Terminal on Linux, 
or Terminal on macOS. This document will use the [Tabby.sh](https://tabby.sh/) application, which works on all three 
operating systems.

#### 2.1.2. Download the application

Go to the [Tabby.sh](https://tabby.sh/) website, click the **Download** button, and download the software suitable 
for your operating system.

<Frame caption="https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby/releases" >
  <img src="/images/tabbysh-terminal-website.png" />
</Frame>

After completing the installation, run it and select the Serial port as shown in the screenshot below.

<Frame caption="Todo: Tabby terminal and serial port">
  <img height="200" width="200" src="/images/under-construction.png" />
</Frame>

### 2.2. Remote Desktop Connection via Browser with VNC

Browser

### 2.3. Network Connection via SSH

Ethernet

### 2.4. Update the Gemstone Operating System

Gemstone development boards include a customized real-time Linux kernel-based Debian/Ubuntu operating system. 
While the version you installed via GemImager is up-to-date, you can update any existing Ubuntu/Debian 
packages using the method below.

<Note>
The following operations should be performed on the board via the command line by clicking the Terminal 
icon in the top menu when connected via remote desktop from a browser or via SSH/Console from your computer's 
Terminal. If you have no prior experience using Linux, you can gain experience by reading the 
[Beginner's Guide](./guides/basic) in the [Training Guides](./guides/introduction).
</Note>

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
