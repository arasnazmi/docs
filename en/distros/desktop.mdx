Our desktop distribution is built on **Xfce4**, a lightweight yet feature-rich desktop environment designed for
stability and efficiency. We carefully selected components to ensure a seamless user experience while maintaining low
resource usage—ideal for single-board computers (SBCs).

## 1. Features

We evaluated several desktop environments and made the following decisions:

- **Xfce over LXDE**: While LXDE is lightweight, it lacks system-wide settings panels and other features that Xfce
  provides out of the box.
- **X11 over Wayland**: Wayland offers modern features but is not yet mature enough for widespread compatibility. Many
  applications still rely on X11, and we prioritized stability for our users.

Our Xfce4-based distro includes the following core components:

### 1.1. Core System

- **Configuration Management**: `xfconf`
- **Desktop Manager**: `xfdesktop4`
- **Display (Login) Manager**: `lightdm` with `lightdm-gtk-greeter`
- **Panel**: `xfce4-panel` with plugins:
  - `xfce4-indicator-plugin` (system indicators)
  - `xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin` (audio control)
  - `xfce4-xkb-plugin` (keyboard layout management)
- **Session Manager**: `xfce4-session`
- **Settings Manager**: `xfce4-settings`
- **Window Manager**: `xfwm4`

### 1.2. Utilities

- **Application Launcher**: `xfce4-appfinder`
- **Disk Usage Analyzer**: `baobab`
- **Network Management**: `network-manager` + `network-manager-gnome`
- **Task Manager**: `xfce4-taskmanager`

### 1.3. Applications

- **Archive Manager**: `engrampa`
- **Calculator**: `mate-calc`
- **File Management**: `thunar` with plugins:
  - `thunar-archive-plugin` (archive support)
  - `catfish` (file search support)
- **Image Viewer**: `ristretto`
- **Media Player**: `parole`
- **PDF Viewer**: `atril`
- **Terminal**: `xfce4-terminal`

## 3. Configuration

The `xfce4-settings` program provides a centralized way to customize your desktop environment. You can access these
settings via the **Setting Manager** icon in the panel, by clicking `Settings > Settings Manager` from the applications menu 
or by running `xfce4-settings-manager` in the terminal.

  and properties used by Xfce components. Used for fine-tuning settings not available in standard UI.

## 4. Conclusion

By leveraging Xfce4’s modularity and mature ecosystem, we aim to deliver a **fast, customizable, and stable** desktop
experience. The selected applications ensure compatibility while minimizing resource usage.
