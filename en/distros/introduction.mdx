Gemstone development boards feature a total of 3 different Operating System Images, each created for specific 
purposes and containing additional packages. For example, while the **Desktop** image described in the Quick Start 
and Development sections of the documentation represents a fully functional computer with desktop components and 
mouse support, the Minimal image is specifically optimized for IoT and Embedded Projects.

This section will explain the contents of each image and the types of projects they're suitable for. At the end of 
the section, we'll cover the services included in the operating system and some specific software components.
