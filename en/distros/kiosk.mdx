<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will gain experience in the following topics:

* Understanding what a Kiosk image is and where it can be used.
* Automatically launching a graphical application on system startup after loading the Gemstone Kiosk image onto the card.
</Tip>

The term "Kiosk" is generally used for computers where users interact with the system via a touchscreen. These systems
support touch input and have a graphical interface but do not host desktop applicationsâ€”they are much smaller and faster
to boot. Examples include autonomous vehicle driver consoles, command and control panel management screens, ATM
displays, and queue management systems.

## 1. Features

Linux systems offer multiple methods and graphical subsystems for running GUI applications. These methods differ in how
they process and render visual content to the screen.

- **X11 (X Window System)** is the traditional and most widely used windowing system; it operates on a client-server
  architecture and allows applications to be displayed over a network.
- **Wayland** is a modern protocol designed to replace X11, offering a simpler, performance-oriented structure with
  lower latency by communicating directly with the DRM/KMS kernel module.
- **DirectFB** is a lightweight graphics library often preferred in embedded systems, drawing directly to the
  framebuffer for fast graphics processing without complex layers like X11 or Wayland.
- **LinuxFB** is a simple method that accesses the Linux kernel's framebuffer device directly, useful for low-resource
  systems but lacking advanced graphics features.

Additionally, GUI frameworks like Qt or GTK can integrate with various graphics systems. For example, Qt applications
can run directly on the framebuffer or Wayland using platform plugins like **eglfs (Embedded OpenGL Full Screen)**.

Each method suits different use cases and can be chosen based on factors like performance, compatibility, or resource
usage. The Gemstone Kiosk image uses **X11** due to its widespread adoption and compatibility with many applications. 

For full-screen kiosk applications on X11, the highly configurable and lightweight **Openbox** window manager is used.
Window borders, titles, management keys, dragging, keyboard shortcuts, etc. are disabled from Openbox settings
(`$HOME/.config/openbox/rc.xml`) to better suit kiosk needs.

## 2. Installation

As described in the [Quick Start](../quickstart#1-installation) section, connect Gemstone to your computer, launch the
Gemstone Imager application, and click on the **Operating System** section.

In the Operating System selection screen, clicking on Ubuntu or Debian images will display options like Desktop, Kiosk,
and Minimal. Select the Kiosk image to complete the writing process.

After the image is loaded, powering on Gemstone will launch the **Demo** application by default. The Demo app is
developed with PyQt6, and its source code is available in the
[t3gemstone/examples](https://github.com/t3gemstone/examples/tree/main/gui) repository.

## 3. Configuration

<Note>
X11 clients use the `DISPLAY` environment variable to determine where to render the display. When connecting via serial
terminal or SSH, this variable must be set manually. Its format is `<hostname>:<display server number>.<screen number>`.
If the display server runs locally, the hostname is omitted. Below is an example usage. In most cases, `DISPLAY=:0.0` is
common.

```bash
ubuntu@host:~$ ssh gemstone@10.0.0.1 DISPLAY=:0.0 xrandr --query
```

- Since the display server runs on the Gemstone card and we connect via SSH, the hostname is omitted.
- Modern systems typically run a single display server, so server number `0` is used.
- Even with multiple monitors, modern systems often use a single virtual screen, so screen number `0` is used.
</Note>

After connecting to the Gemstone card via [serial port or SSH](../quickstart#2-1-seriport), you can configure the
necessary settings using environment variables in the `$HOME/kiosk.environment` file. The environment variables listed
in this file and their functions are shown in the table below.

| Environment Variable       | Default Value                     | Function                                                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PATH`                     | `$HOME/bin:$PATH`                 | Directories where applications will be searched              |
| `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`          | `/usr/local/qt6:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` | Directories where dynamic libraries (.so) will be searched   |
| `KIOSK_RESOLUTION`         | `800x600`                         | Screen resolution                                            |
| `KIOSK_REFRESH_RATE`       | `60`                              | Screen refresh rate                                          |
| `KIOSK_LOG_PATH`           | `$HOME/kiosk.log`                 | Directory where application stdout and stderr will be logged |
| `KIOSK_LOG_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` | `104857600`                       | Maximum size of the log file in bytes                        |
| `KIOSK_BIN`                | `kiosk`                           | Application to be executed                                   |

For the changes in the settings to take effect, it is sufficient to restart the Openbox session using the following
command.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ DISPLAY=:0.0 openbox --exit
```

You can list the current resolution and refresh rate values for your screen using the following command.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ DISPLAY=:0.0 xrandr --query
# Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 8096 x 8096
# HDMI-1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 527mm x 296mm
#    1920x1080     60.00*+  50.00    59.94
#    1680x1050     59.88
#    1600x900      60.00
#    1280x1024     75.02    60.02
#    1440x900      59.90
#    1366x768      59.79
#    1152x864      75.00
#    1280x720      60.00    50.00    59.94
#    1024x768      75.03    70.07    60.00
#    832x624       74.55
#    800x600       72.19    75.00    60.32    56.25
#    720x576       50.00
#    720x480       60.00    59.94
#    640x480       75.00    72.81    60.00    59.94
#    720x400       70.08
```

The Kiosk application is located in the `$HOME/bin/kiosk` directory by default. To replace or update the application,
send the new application to this directory using `scp` as shown below, then restart the Openbox session.

```bash
ubuntu@host:~$ scp kiosk gemstone@10.0.0.1:bin/kiosk
ubuntu@host:~$ ssh gemstone@10.0.0.1 DISPLAY=:0.0 openbox --exit
```

## 4. Architecture

The stages from powering on the Gemstone card to displaying the Kiosk application are listed below.

1. Systemd starts the `getty@tty1` service. This service automatically logs in the `gemstone` user from the terminal
   named tty1.
2. The default shell of the `gemstone` user, `/bin/bash`, is launched.
3. The `$HOME/.profile` script is executed by the Bash shell. This script contains the `startx` command, which launches
   **Xserver**, the display server for X11. If Xserver crashes for any reason, the status is logged in the systemd
   journal with the `kiosk` tag, and `startx` is executed again.
4. The `$HOME/.xinitrc` script is executed by Xserver. This script contains the `exec openbox-session` command, which
   launches the Openbox session.
5. The `$HOME/.config/openbox/autostart` script is executed by Openbox. This script launches the application defined by
   the `KIOSK_BIN` environment variable. The stdout and stderr outputs of this application are logged to the file
   defined by the `KIOSK_LOG_PATH` environment variable. If the Kiosk application crashes for any reason, the status is
   logged in the systemd journal with the `kiosk` tag, and the application is restarted.

## 5. Conclusion

While the Desktop image allows login with a username and password, the Kiosk image is a type of image where only your
specified application is automatically launched, and there is no access to the system via the screen.
