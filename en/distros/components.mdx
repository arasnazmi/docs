<Note>
When you receive your Gemstone card and boot up your system for the first time, this new world might feel a bit
unfamiliar. This guide is designed for users taking their first steps into the Linux and Ubuntu world to effectively use
T3 Gemstone OS. Intermediate to advanced Linux users may skip this section.
</Note>

## 1. Linux Philosophy

### 1.1. Open Source Approach

T3 Gemstone OS is built on Debian/Ubuntu, which is based on the open-source software philosophy. This means you have
full control over the system, can access the source code, and customize it according to your needs.

### 1.2. "Everything is a File" Principle

One of the most fundamental concepts in the Linux world is the **"everything is a file"** principle. This means that
everything from hardware components to processes is accessible through the file system. Hardware components like I2C,
SPI, UART, and GPIO on your Gemstone card are also represented as files under this philosophy.

### 1.3. Modular Structure

Linux systems have a modular structure. Each component performs a specific task and communicates with other components
through standard interfaces. This approach allows you to run different applications and services independently on your
Gemstone card. For example, if you don't like the file manager in the Desktop image, you can easily replace it with an
alternative file manager. This freedom sets Linux operating systems apart from their competitors.

## 2. Linux Basics

### 2.1. Boot Process

When your Gemstone card boots up, the system starts in a specific sequence. First, the bootloader takes over, then the
Linux kernel is loaded, and finally, the systemd init system starts running. During this process, the system detects
your hardware, loads the necessary drivers, and starts system services.

### 2.2. Kernel Space and User Space Separation

The Linux operating system is divided into two main sections for security and stability: **Kernel Space** and 
**User Space**. This separation controls access to hardware resources, ensuring system security.

#### 2.2.1. Kernel Space

Kernel space is where the heart of the operating system resides. This space provides direct access to hardware resources
and manages the system's core functions. For example, when you plug in a USB device, the relevant driver in kernel space
detects the device and makes it ready for use. Similarly, all processes managing your computer's memory, accessing the
file system, and controlling network traffic occur in kernel space. Code running in this space has high privileges, and
an error here can crash the entire system. Therefore, access to kernel space is tightly controlled.

#### 2.2.2. User Space

User space is where users directly interact. For example, when you open a terminal and type a command in T3 Gemstone OS
or use a web browser, these applications run in user space. Programs in user space cannot access hardware directly;
instead, they send system calls to the kernel to perform their tasks. For instance, a program wanting to read a text
file requests the kernel to access the file system. This way, an error in a user space application does not affect the
rest of the system and only causes that application to crash.

#### 2.2.3. Example Scenario: Opening a File

1. **User Space:** The `cat /etc/gemstone/config.txt` command runs.
2. **Kernel Space:**
   - The command makes a **system call (`open()` syscall)**.
   - The kernel checks the file's permissions (`chmod` & `chown` rules).
   - If authorized, it **accesses the disk** and reads the data.
3. **User Space:** The kernel sends the read data to the terminal.

### 2.3. Process Structure

Every running program is called a process. In Linux, these processes are organized hierarchically, and each has a unique
identification number (**PID**) and a parent identification number (**PPID**). The first process to start is
`/sbin/init`, which is the parent of all other processes. In T3 Gemstone OS, this process is `systemd`.

### 2.4. File System Hierarchy

The Linux file system (rootfs) is organized according to Unix standards. The root directory (`/`) is the topmost point
of the system, and all other directories branch from here.

- `/bin` and `/usr/bin` directories contain basic programs. Commands like `ls`, `cp`, and `mv` used daily are located
  here.
- `/etc` is the central hub for system configuration files. Network settings, service configurations, and system-wide
  settings are stored here.
- `/home` contains user folders. Your personal files and settings are located here.
- `/var` stores variable data files. Log files, databases, and temporary files created by processes reside here.
- `/dev` contains device files. Hardware components like I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, and others on your Gemstone card are
  represented as files here.
- `/sys` provides system information from the kernel. Hardware status, driver parameters, and system statistics are
  found here.
- `/proc` provides information about running processes and the kernel. This virtual file system allows real-time
  monitoring of system status.

### 2.5. User Permissions

In the Linux world, there are two main user categories: the root user and regular users.

#### 2.5.1. Root User

The root user can be thought of as the CEO of a company. Just as a CEO has access to all departments, the root user has
unlimited authority over the system.

The root user can read, write, and delete any file on the system. They can run any program, change system settings, and
even make irreversible changes like formatting the entire system. The root user perfectly exemplifies the principle that
"with great power comes great responsibility."

#### 2.5.2. Regular Users

Regular users are like department employees operating in specific areas of the system. While they have full authority in
their own `home` directories, they cannot modify system files, stop or start critical services, or make system-wide
changes. This restriction keeps the system secure and stable.

When working as a regular user on your Gemstone card, you can develop your projects, manage personal files, and run most
programs. However, you will need additional permissions for tasks like installing new software, managing system
services, or modifying system configuration files.

#### 2.5.3. Gaining Root Privileges with Sudo

The **sudo (superuser do)** command acts as a secure bridge, allowing regular users to run specific commands with root
privileges. Think of it as an employee obtaining a signed authorization from the CEO for specific situations.

The biggest advantage of sudo is eliminating the risks of constantly working as the root user. Every mistake made as
root poses a potential threat to the system. By elevating privileges only when necessary, you maintain both security and
system integrity.

## 3. Terminal Usage

The terminal is the heart of Linux systems. Almost anything you can do in the graphical interface can be done faster and
more efficiently via the terminal. This section covers the essential commands you need to actively use the Linux
terminal. This is just the tip of the iceberg. As you research the problems you encounter, you will start learning new
commands and methods every day. When you begin automating repetitive tasks by asking, "How can I do this more
effectively?" and using terminal commands, you will reach the level of a **Power User**.

In commands, entries shown within `< >` characters are dummy (example) inputs and should be replaced with actual inputs
as needed.

```bash
touch <file_name> # dummy
touch file.txt    # actual (do not include '<' and '>' characters!)
```

### 3.1. Getting Help with man Pages

One of Linux's most powerful features is its comprehensive documentation system. To get detailed explanations for any
command, you can use the **man (manual)** command:

```bash
man ls # explains the usage of the ls command
man cp # explains the usage of the cp command
```

Use the up/down arrow keys to navigate man pages and press `q` to exit.

### 3.2. Package Management with APT

Since T3 Gemstone OS is Debian/Ubuntu-based, it uses the **APT (Advanced Package Tool)** package manager. When you need
to install new software or update existing software, you can use the APT tool:

```bash
sudo apt update                 # Updates the package list
sudo apt upgrade                # Upgrades installed packages (run update first)
sudo apt install <package_name> # Installs a new package
sudo apt remove <package_name>  # Removes a package
sudo apt search <search_term>   # Searches for a package
```

### 3.3. File Operations

Basic commands for working with files and directories:

```bash
ls -la                         # Lists directory contents in detail
cd </path/to/dir>              # Changes directory
mkdir <new_directory>          # Creates a new directory
cp <source_file> <target_file> # Copies a file from source to target
mv <old_name> <new_name>       # Moves/renames a file
rm <file_name>                 # Deletes a file
```

### 3.4. Changing File and Directory Ownership with chown

In Linux, every file and directory has an owner and a group. The **chown (change owner)** command is used to change the
owner and/or group of files or directories. This is especially important in systems with multiple users or for access
control of specific files.

```bash
chown <username>:<group_name> <file_or_directory_name> # Changes ownership of a single file or directory
chown -R <username>:<group_name> <directory_name>      # Recursively changes ownership of all files and subdirectories
```

<Warning>
- Root privileges are required to change ownership of system files or files owned by other users.
- Be cautious when changing ownership of system files, as it may cause some applications to stop working.
</Warning>

<Note>
You can facilitate file sharing by assigning users to groups. For example, users in the `dialout` group can access
serial ports without root privileges.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout <username>
```
</Note>

### 3.5. Managing File and Directory Permissions with chmod

In Linux, every file and directory has specific permissions. These permissions determine who can read, edit, or execute
your files. The **chmod (change mode)** command is used to change these permissions.

Linux has three types of permissions:

- **Read (r)**: Permission to view the file's content.
- **Write (w)**: Permission to modify or delete the file.
- **Execute (x)**: Permission to run the file as a program (for scripts or applications).

These permissions are assigned to three different user groups:

- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: The group the file belongs to.
- **Others**: All other users.

Similar rules apply to directories, but the **execute (x)** permission means the ability to `cd` into the directory.

You can use the chmod command in two ways: symbolic (with letters) and numeric (with numbers).

#### 3.5.1. Symbolic Method

Use `+` and `-` signs to add or remove permissions, and the following symbols to specify user groups:

- `u`: Owner
- `g`: Group
- `o`: Others
- `a`: All

```bash
chmod +x <file_name>  # Adds execute permission for all users
chmod u+w <file_name> # Adds write permission only for the owner
```

#### 3.5.2. Numeric Method

Each permission is represented by its binary equivalent:

- `4`: Read (r)
- `2`: Write (w)
- `1`: Execute (x)

You can determine permissions by adding these numbers. For example, the command `chmod 755 script.sh` means:

- `7`: 4 + 2 + 1 = `rwx` (owner)
- `5`: 4 + 1 = `r-x` (group)
- `5`: 4 + 1 = `r-x` (others)

<Warning>
- Avoid using `chmod 777`! 

  This makes the file **world-writable** (`rwxrwxrwx`) and poses a security risk.
- Be cautious when changing permissions of system files, as it may cause some applications to stop working.
</Warning>

### 3.6. nano Text Editor

**nano** is an ideal terminal text editor for beginners. Its simple and intuitive interface allows you to edit
configuration files without leaving the terminal:

```bash
nano <file_name> # Edits the file
```

The nano interface's bottom panel displays commonly used keyboard shortcuts. Here, the `^` prefix represents the `Ctrl`
key, and the `M` prefix represents the `Alt` key. For example, use `^O` (`Ctrl+O`) to save the file, `^X` (`Ctrl+X`) to
exit, and `M-6` (`Alt+6`) to copy text.

### 3.7. Pipe and Output Redirection

One of Linux's most powerful features is the ability to chain commands. The pipe (`|`) symbol allows you to use the
output of one command as the input of another:

```bash
ls -la | grep -i ".txt" # Lists only .txt files
sudo dmesg | tail -20   # Shows the last 20 kernel messages
```

Output redirection allows you to save command results to files and provide files as input to commands:

```bash
ls -la > file_list.txt # Saves output to a file (overwrites existing data)
cat < file_list.txt    # Provides the file as input to the program
echo "test" >> log.txt # Appends output to the file (preserves existing data)
```

<Warning>
The `<` and `>` characters are used for redirection and are not dummy inputs.
</Warning>

### 3.8. Process Management with htop

**htop** allows you to visually monitor system resources and running processes:

```bash
htop
```

Inside htop, use `F9` to terminate processes, `F3` to search, and `F4` to filter. For example, start filtering with
`F4`, type "htop," press `F9`, select `15 SIGTERM`, and press `Enter` to send a termination signal to the "htop"
process, closing the program.

### 3.9. Network Management with nmtui

To manage your Gemstone card's network connection, use the nmtui program:

```bash
nmtui
```

This tool allows you to connect to Wi-Fi networks, configure Ethernet IP settings, and manage network profiles. Its
simple and intuitive interface simplifies network connection management and saves settings to profiles for persistence.

### 3.10. Checking Connected External Hardware

```bash
lsusb # Lists connected USB devices
lspci # Lists connected PCI devices
```

### 3.11. Managing Hardware Drivers

In Linux, drivers are typically implemented as kernel modules. Drivers for special hardware components on your Gemstone
card are automatically loaded into the kernel at boot.

```bash
lsmod                  # Lists loaded kernel modules
modinfo <module_name>  # Provides information about a module
modprobe <module_name> # Loads a module into the kernel
rmmod <module_name>    # Removes a module from the kernel
```

### 3.12. Firewall Management

```bash
sudo ufw status   # Shows firewall status
sudo ufw enable   # Enables the firewall
sudo ufw allow 22 # Opens the SSH port
sudo ufw allow 80 # Opens the HTTP port
```

### 3.13. User Management

```bash
sudo adduser <username>          # Adds a new user
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> # Adds the user to the sudo group
sudo passwd <username>           # Changes the user's password
sudo deluser <username>          # Deletes the user
```

### 3.14. Systemd and Service Management

Systemd is the default init system in T3 Gemstone OS. It manages system startup, controls services, and monitors system
status.

The following examples use the nginx service. Replace "nginx" with the name of the service you want to configure. If you
don't know the service name, you can find it using the `systemctl list-units` command.

#### 3.14.1. Checking Service Status

```bash
systemctl status          # Shows the status of all services
systemctl status nginx    # Shows the status of the Nginx service
systemctl is-active nginx # Checks if the service is active
```

#### 3.14.2. Starting and Stopping Services

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx   # Starts the Nginx service
sudo systemctl stop nginx    # Stops the Nginx service
sudo systemctl restart nginx # Restarts the Nginx service
sudo systemctl reload nginx  # Reloads the Nginx configuration
```

#### 3.14.3. Configuring Automatic Startup

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx  # Enables automatic startup for Nginx
sudo systemctl disable nginx # Disables automatic startup for Nginx
```

#### 3.14.4. Creating Custom Services

To create a systemd service file for your own application, create a `.service` file in the `/etc/systemd/system/`
directory.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/backup-ssd.service # Creates a service file named backup-ssd.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload                     # Reloads the systemctl service list
sudo systemctl enable --now backup-ssd           # Enables automatic startup and starts the service immediately
```

### 3.15. Troubleshooting

#### 3.15.1. Kernel Messages with dmesg

When encountering hardware or software issues at the system level, the first thing to check is the output of the 
**dmesg (diagnostic messages)** command, i.e., kernel messages:

```bash
sudo dmesg | tail -50      # Shows the last 50 kernel messages
sudo dmesg | grep -i error # Searches for error messages
sudo dmesg | grep -i usb   # Finds USB-related messages
```

For example, if your network card stops working after a kernel update despite previously functioning normally, the dmesg
output will likely contain error messages from the network card's driver.

To monitor kernel messages in real-time:

```bash
sudo dmesg -w # Monitors new kernel messages live
```

#### 3.15.2. System Logs with journalctl

**journalctl** is systemd's log management tool, allowing you to view all system logs from a central location:

```bash
journalctl -f                      # Tails logs in real-time
journalctl -r                      # Shows logs in reverse order (newest first)
journalctl -r -u nginx             # Shows logs for the Nginx service
journalctl -r --since "1 hour ago" # Shows logs from the last hour
journalctl -r --until "2025-07-18" # Shows logs until the specified date
journalctl -r -p err               # Shows only error-level logs
```

#### 3.15.3. Diagnosing Common Issues

To check disk usage:

```bash
df -h          # Shows disk usage
sudo du -sh /* # Shows the size of directories under root (takes longer due to recursive search)
```

To check memory usage:

```bash
free -h # Shows memory usage
```

Similarly, using the htop program, you can monitor memory usage, CPU core utilization percentages, the number of running
processes, and disk read/write percentages in the I/O tab.

```bash
htop
```

For network connection issues:

```bash
ping 1.1.1.1        # Tests internet connectivity (if connected, the server responds)
ping cloudflare.com # Tests DNS server connectivity (if DNS works, the server responds)
ip addr show        # Shows network interfaces
```
