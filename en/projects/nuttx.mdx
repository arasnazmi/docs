<Warning>
NuttX support for Gemstone is currently under development. Not all peripherals on the board are usable at this time.
</Warning>

NuttX is an open-source operating system designed for real-time applications. Compliant with POSIX and ANSI standards,
NuttX is optimized for embedded systems and microcontrollers. The primary reason for choosing NuttX for the R5F cores on
the Gemstone board is its deterministic behavior and reliable management of real-time tasks. Additionally, NuttX is a
platform supported by popular autopilot software like Ardupilot and PX4, making it critical for drone and autonomous
vehicle projects.

Since there is no official NuttX support for the AM67A SoC yet, a custom configuration named `beagley-ai` has been
created. This configuration is tailored to the hardware features of our board and the capabilities of the R5F cores.

## Toolchain Installation

To compile NuttX, we need a cross-compiler compatible with ARM Cortex-R5F cores. The `gcc-arm-none-eabi` toolchain is
the standard solution for this requirement.

On Ubuntu/Debian systems, you can install the toolchain using the package manager:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest version from ARM's official website and perform a manual installation. After
installation, verify the toolchain is working correctly with the command `arm-none-eabi-gcc --version`.

## Downloading the Source Code

The NuttX ecosystem consists of two main repositories: the core operating system and the application framework. To
download the customized versions for the Gemstone board, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the main NuttX repository
git clone https://github.com/t3gemstone/nuttx.git

# Clone the NuttX applications as the 'apps' folder
git clone https://github.com/t3gemstone/nuttx-apps.git apps

# Navigate to the main working directory
cd nuttx
```

This setup creates the standard directory structure expected by NuttX. The `apps` folder contains the applications and
services that will run on the operating system.

## Applying the Configuration

NuttX uses pre-prepared configurations for different hardware platforms. Let's start by applying the `beagley-ai`
configuration for our Gemstone board:

```bash
./tools/configure.sh -l beagley-ai:nsh
```

This command configures the basic settings tailored to the AM67A SoC and enables NuttShell (nsh), a simple command-line
interface. NuttShell allows you to perform basic file operations and system management tasks.

## Customizing the Configuration

Sometimes, you may need to modify the default configuration. NuttX uses a menuconfig tool similar to the Linux kernel:

```bash
make menuconfig
```

Through this graphical interface, you can enable drivers, adjust memory settings, or add new features. To save your
changes permanently, use the savedefconfig command:

```bash
make savedefconfig
```

This command saves only the configurations that differ from the defaults, preventing unnecessary bloating of the
configuration file.

## Debug Configuration

By default, NuttX is configured in release mode, producing a small-sized binary optimized for performance but lacking
debug information. For step-by-step debugging during development, you need to switch to debug mode.

Open the menuconfig tool and navigate to: `Build Setup` → `Debug Options` → `Enable Debug Features`. Also, enable the
`Generate Debug Symbols` option. These settings ensure the compiler embeds debug information into the binary, allowing
the debugger to perform source-level debugging.

## Compilation Process

Once the configuration is complete, you can compile NuttX:

```bash
make -j$(nproc)
```

This command performs parallel compilation using all available CPU cores. The compilation results in an ELF file named
`nuttx`, which contains the operating system image to be loaded onto the R5F core.

## CCS IDE Integration

Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio (CCS) is a development environment specifically optimized for the AM67A SoC
family. To integrate your NuttX project into CCS, open the IDE and use `File` → `Import` → `C/C++` → 
`Existing Code as Makefile Project`.

Select the `nuttx` folder as the project directory and specify `Cross GCC` as the toolchain. This configuration allows
CCS to understand the NuttX source code and provide features like syntax highlighting and code navigation.

## Debug Preparation with SBL NULL

Under normal operating conditions, the `tiboot3.bin` file located in the SD card's boot partition launches the U-Boot
bootloader. However, to enable debug access to the R5F cores, we need to replace this file with the `tiboot3.bin`
produced by the SBL NULL project.

SBL NULL is a special version of the System Boot Loader. This version initializes the SoC at a basic level and leaves
the R5F cores in WFI (Wait For Interrupt) mode. This state allows the cores to wait for the debugger to connect without
executing any code.

Insert the SD card into your computer, back up the `tiboot3.bin` file in the boot partition, and replace it with the
file produced by SBL NULL. Reinsert the card into the Gemstone board and power it on.

## Debugging Process

To start debugging in CCS IDE, first open your Target Configuration file and connect to the AM67A SoC. From the 
`Run` → `Debug` menu, select the MCU R5F core.

Once the debugger is connected, use `Run` → `Load` → `Load Program` to select the `nuttx` ELF file. This process loads
the NuttX operating system into the R5F core's memory.

After the program is loaded, you can set breakpoints, monitor variables, and step through the code. This allows you to
examine critical components like NuttX's task scheduler and interrupt handlers in detail.

## Cleanup Operations

During development, you may occasionally need a fresh start. NuttX provides two levels of cleanup commands:

```bash
# Cleans only object files and binaries
make clean

# Cleans all build files and configurations
make distclean
```

The `make clean` command removes files generated during compilation but preserves the configuration. `make distclean`
resets the project to its initial state, requiring you to reconfigure it.

Once this process is complete, your Gemstone board's R5F cores will be running a fully functional NuttX operating
system, providing a solid foundation for your real-time applications.
