Gemstone boards contain features covering software/hardware topics from various disciplines. To master 
all of these, basic Linux usage is essential. The resources below are aimed at beginner-level usage of Linux 
tools for this purpose.

<Note>
It is assumed that you have either installed a GNU/Linux distribution like Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora or Pardus on 
your computer, or set up a virtual machine using virtualization tools like VirtualBox. All work in the 
documentation should be done on Linux.
</Note>

<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will have knowledge and experience in the following areas:

* Learning basic Linux usage
* Using scripts/shell in Linux
* Developing software on Linux
* Compiling and running C/C++ projects
</Tip>

It is important to read all resources in order and not move on to the next ones before completing them. 
Before creating a study plan, quickly review all the links by clicking through them. If you encounter 
difficulties, you can consult the Gemstone Community Forums or research solutions using search engines. 
All resources form a cohesive wholeâ€”points that seem unclear at first will naturally resolve 
themselves as you progress.
