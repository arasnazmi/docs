In this century, where technology is advancing at an incredible pace and permeating every aspect of life, it is 
an absolute truth that science and knowledge cannot remain under anyone's monopoly—this is a universal principle. 
As the T3 Foundation, all the work here is carried out in line with this principle, with the aim of sharing and 
developing projects for the benefit of humanity.

In this section, training guides and resources on new technologies, software engineering, and other topics are 
shared for students, entrepreneurs, engineers, and technology enthusiasts of all ages to delve deeper into the 
Gemstone project. Each section specifies resources by level and outlines what kind of projects can be developed 
upon completion.

In this era where the world is becoming increasingly digitized, virtualized, and life is becoming easier - yet also more chaotic - if 
you, as a **T3 Gemstone Community Member**, 
say, **"I also have something to say to the world,"** then don’t wait, 
we’re here for you!
