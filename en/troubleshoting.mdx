## Unable to Start GemImager

If you receive errors such as 
`The code execution cannot continue because Qt6SerialPort.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem.` 
or `.dll not found` when starting the application, please download the latest version
from http://www.t3gemstone.org/software. If an unresolved problem persists even with the new version, you can
temporarily use [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/) to perform the writing operation. To contribute, you can
report the issue at https://github.com/t3gemstone/gem-imager/issues.
