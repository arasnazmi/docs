<Note>
This section covers the configuration file structure of the tool called Debos, which is used to compile images for 
Gemstone development boards. Before starting this section, you should have read the 
[Components](./components#3-6-debos) section.
</Note>

<Tip>
Before proceeding, make sure you have reviewed the following files:

* [sdk/distrobox.ini](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/blob/main/distrobox.ini)
* [sdk/Dockerfile](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/blob/main/Dockerfile)
* [sdk/distro/distro.yaml](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/blob/main/distro/distro.yaml)
* [sdk/distro/Taskfile.yml](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/blob/main/distro/Taskfile.yml) 
</Tip>

As of the date this document was written, Gemstone development boards support 
<Tooltip tip="ubuntu-22, ubuntu-24, debian-11, debian-12">4 Distributions</Tooltip>, 
<Tooltip tip="Desktop, Kiosk, Minimal">3 Image Types</Tooltip>, and 
<Tooltip tip="beagley-ai, intel-corei7-64, t3-gem-o1, qemuarm64">4 Machines</Tooltip>.
Each Image, Machine, and Distribution has its own unique differences and customization settings.

When creating a distribution, the commands `devbox shell` --> `task box` --> `task distro:build` are called sequentially. 
Debos is then launched inside Docker, where customizations are made based on the provided variables, 
[necessary files are copied](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/blob/main/distro/overlays), and 
[installation scripts](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/blob/main/distro/scripts) are executed.

```bash Example
task distro:build MACHINE=intel-corei7-64 DISTRO_TYPE=desktop DISTRO_BASE=ubuntu DISTRO_SUITE=jammy IMG_SIZE=16G
```

## 1. Parameters

A few parameters are summarized here. For the rest, refer to the `vars` section in the 
[sdk/Taskfile.yml](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/blob/main/Taskfile.yml) file.

<ParamField body="MACHINE" default="t3-gem-o1" required>
  `beagley-ai` `intel-corei7-64` `t3-gem-o1` `qemuarm64`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="DISTRO_TYPE" default="desktop" required>
  `minimal` `desktop` `kiosk`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="DISTRO_BASE" default="ubuntu" required>
  `ubuntu` `debian`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="DISTRO_SUITE" default="jammy" required>
  `jammy` `noble` `bullseye` `bookworm`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="DISTRO_ARCH" default="amd64" required>
  `amd64` `arm64`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="IMG_SIZE" default="4GB">
  The size of the resulting **.img** file after building.
</ParamField>

## 2. Distributions

During the process of uploading an image to a new board using the Gemstone Imager application, the above 
distributions can be selected. By default, **Ubuntu 22.04** is preferred on Gemstone development boards, 
but Debian 11 and 12 images are also supported to meet the needs of different projects.

<Tip>
In Debian distributions (roughly speaking), the core principle is **security and stability**, while Ubuntu 
distributions prioritize the same principles along with more frequent updates and delivering newer versions of 
packages to end-users. Users' preferences depend entirely on their system definitions and needs.
</Tip>

<ParamField body="Ubuntu 22" type="DISTRO_BASE=ubuntu DISTRO_SUITE=jammy">
Ubuntu's latest LTS (Long-term support) version is 24.04, but 22.04 is preferred due to various issues encountered 
in projects like ROS and Yocto.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Ubuntu 24" type="DISTRO_BASE=ubuntu DISTRO_SUITE=noble">
Preferred for the latest libraries and applications.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Debian 11" type="DISTRO_BASE=debian DISTRO_SUITE=bullseye">
Used in projects where the current code is stable for Debian 11.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Debian 12" type="DISTRO_BASE=debian DISTRO_SUITE=bookworm">
The latest version of Debian.
</ParamField>

## 3. Images

<ParamField body="Minimal" type="DISTRO_TYPE=minimal">
Can be used in IoT, Real-Time Systems, Network Applications, Embedded Software, Manned and Unmanned Vehicles, 
Smart Home Applications, Autopilot, etc.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Desktop" type="DISTRO_TYPE=desktop">
Can be used for testing, prototyping, development, education, or as a small computer.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Kiosk" type="DISTRO_TYPE=kiosk">
Can be used in projects like touchscreen Kiosks, Autonomous Vehicle Panels, Command Control Panels, etc.
</ParamField>

## 4. Machines

<ParamField body="Gemstone Obsidian" type="MACHINE=t3-gem-o1 DISTRO_ARCH=arm64">
The machine type for the T3 Gemstone Obsidian development board.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Intel Core-i7" type="MACHINE=intel-corei7-64 DISTRO_ARCH=amd64">
Preferred for virtual use with QEMU.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="BeagleY AI" type="MACHINE=beagley-ai DISTRO_ARCH=arm64">
The created images can also be used on the BeagleY-AI development board.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="Qemu ARM64" type="MACHINE=qemuarm64 DISTRO_ARCH=arm64">
Preferred for virtual use with QEMU.
</ParamField>

## 5. Configuration File

The Debos tool reads the [sdk/distro/distro.yaml](https://github.com/t3gemstone/sdk/blob/main/distro/distro.yaml) 
file and performs a 4-step process to create the `.img` file/distribution.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Debootstrap/Apt">
    Based on the specified Distribution (Ubuntu or Debian), it downloads all **.deb** packages from the respective 
    distribution's APT servers using the `debootstrap` tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Package Installation">
    Creates a folder structure called `rootfs` to meet GNU/Linux operating system requirements and installs the 
    downloaded **.deb** packages into `rootfs` using the `chroot` method.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customization Processes">
    After the installation of deb packages is complete, files to be included in the image are copied, and 
    installation scripts are executed based on the `overlay` and `run` definitions in the `yaml` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Image File Creation">
    After all the above steps are successfully completed, the boot and rootfs disk partitions are created 
    according to the `image-partition` definition, the **.img** file is generated, and all files are moved into it.
  </Step>
</Steps>
