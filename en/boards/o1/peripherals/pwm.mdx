description: 'Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)'
---

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is a modulation technique used to control the average power level of a signal. Its basic
working principle relies on adjusting the "on" and "off" durations (duty cycle) of a square wave with a fixed period. In
embedded systems, it is used for various purposes such as motor speed control, LED brightness adjustment, servo motor
control, power converters, and analog signal generation. For example, when controlling a motor's speed with PWM, as the
duty cycle value increases, the average voltage delivered to the motor increases, causing the motor to rotate faster.

One of the fundamental parameters of a PWM signal is the **period**, which is the duration of one complete waveform. The
**duty cycle** is the duration the signal remains "on" within one period. **Polarity** determines the active state of
the PWM signal (high or low level). For instance, in normal polarity, the duty cycle represents the high level, while in
inverted polarity, it represents the low level.

### PWM Interfaces

The PWM interfaces available on the T3-GEM-O1 board are listed in the table below.

| Interface     | Device          | GPIO       | Overlay File                               |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **PWM-ECAP0** | `pwmchip0/pwm0` | GPIO-12    | `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-ecap0-gpio12.dtso` |
| **PWM-ECAP1** | `pwmchip1/pwm0` | GPIO-16    | `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-ecap1-gpio16.dtso` |
| **PWM-ECAP2** | `pwmchip2/pwm0` | GPIO-18    | `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-ecap2-gpio18.dtso` |
| **PWM-0A**    | `pwmchip3/pwm0` | GPIO-5     | `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-epwm0-gpio5.dtso`  |
| **PWM-0B**    | `pwmchip3/pwm1` | GPIO-14    | `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-epwm0-gpio14.dtso` |
| **PWM-1A**    | `pwmchip5/pwm0` | GPIO-6     | `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-epwm1-gpio6.dtso`  |
| **PWM-1B**    | `pwmchip5/pwm1` | GPIO-13    | `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-epwm1-gpio13.dtso` |
| **PWM-2A**    | `pwmchip7/pwm0` | FAN header | `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-gpio-fan.dtso`         |

<Note>
To enable PWM-0A and PWM-0B together: `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-epwm0-gpio5-gpio14.dtso`

To enable PWM-1A and PWM-1B together: `k3-am67a-t3-gem-o1-pwm-epwm1-gpio6-gpio13.dtso`
</Note>

<Warning>
The `pwmchip3` and `pwmchip5` chips have two channels, and each channel can be used as a PWM device. However, **different
period values CANNOT be assigned** to the two channels of a PWM chip (e.g., PWM-0A and PWM-0B). As long as the same period
value is given to both channels, there is no issue in assigning different duty cycles.
</Warning>

The names of the overlay files for the interfaces to be enabled should be added to the `overlays` variable in the
`/boot/uEnv.txt` file. Detailed information about overlays can be found in the 
[Device Tree](./introduction/#2-device-tree) section.

When all overlays are enabled, there are **8 separate PWM** interfaces available: 1 from the FAN header and 7 from the 40-pin header.

### PWM Usage

PWM chips can be accessed via the `/sys/class/pwm` sysfs directory. To use a PWM device, an `export` operation must be
performed beforehand. For example, referring to the table above, the `PWM-ECAP0` interface corresponds to the `pwm0`
device of the `pwmchip0` chip. The following command performs the `export` operation, after which the
`/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0` device is created. The reason for writing `echo 0` is that it is the `pwm0` device, i.e.,
device number `0`.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/export
# 0
```

Similarly, if the `PWM-0B` interface is to be used, the `pwm1` device of the `pwmchip3` chip should be activated as
shown in the command below. The reason for writing `echo 1` is that it is the `pwm1` device, i.e., device number `1`.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip3/export
# 1
```

After the `export` operation, the `period` and `duty_cycle` variables, in nanoseconds, can be set to the desired values
as shown in the example below. Once the `enable` variable is set to `1`, the PWM output can be obtained.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 2000000 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/period     # 500 Hz
# 2000000
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 1000000 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/duty_cycle # 50%
# 1000000
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/enable
# 1
```

To stop the PWM output, set the `enable` variable to `0`.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/enable
# 1
```

If the PWM device is no longer needed, an `unexport` operation can be performed. This operation will remove the device
from the system. The reason for writing `echo 0` is that it is the `pwm0` device, i.e., device number `0`.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/unexport
# 0
```
