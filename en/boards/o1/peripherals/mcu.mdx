While Linux is the primary focus of the **T3-GEM-O1** development board, it also leverages the power of the R5 and C7x
cores embedded in the Texas Instruments AM67 microprocessor. This section will explore topics such as compiling software
for the R5 cores, debugging, and related procedures.

<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will gain knowledge and experience in the following areas:

* Compiling Texas AM67 MCU software and running it on the Gemstone Obsidian
* Understanding the boot sequence stages when the development board is first powered on
</Tip>

## 1. MCU Software Development

The necessary tools for compiling MCU projects are listed below:

1. Texas Instruments Processor SDK RTOS J722S
2. Texas Instruments Sysconfig
3. Texas Instruments Code Generation Tools C7000
4. Texas Instruments Code Generation Tools ARM LLVM

Since downloading and installing these individually from the Texas Instruments website is cumbersome,
the [t3gemstone/examples](https://github.com/t3gemstone/examples) repository provides a preconfigured setup with all required tools to compile MCU projects.

### 1.1. Clone example projects with Git

```bash
ubuntu@host:~$ git clone https://github.com/t3gemstone/examples.git
ubuntu@host:~$ cd examples
```

### 1.2. Install the required tools and libraries for compilation

```bash
ubuntu@host:examples$ ./setup.sh
ubuntu@host:examples$ devbox shell
ubuntu@host:examples$ task fetch-ti
```

### 1.3. Create template project

The `mcu` project in the [t3gemstone/examples](https://github.com/t3gemstone/examples) repository contains sample applications running on two R5F real-time cores and two C7x DSP cores. Similar examples can be found in the directory:
`build/ti/ti-processor-sdk-rtos-j722s-evm-10_01_00_04/mcu_plus_sdk_j722s_10_01_00_22/examples`

We recommend finding a sample project matching your requirements, copying it to the `mcu` project directory, and developing on top of it.

Each sample project contains subdirectories for different processor cores. For example, the `hello_world` project includes:
1. `c75ss0-0_freertos`
2. `c75ss1-0_freertos`
3. `main-r5fss0-0_freertos` and
4. `mcu-r5fss0-0_freertos` directories.

Development should be done in the directory corresponding to the target core (one of these four), and the compiled outputs from that specific directory should be used.

MCU projects to be compiled are defined in the `.env` file through the `MCU_TARGETS` variable. To compile a project, add either the absolute or relative path to its `makefile` directory to the `MCU_TARGETS` variable. Below is an example configuration for the `mcu-r5fss0-0_freertos` core of the `hello_world` project:

```bash
MCU_TARGETS="
ipc_rpmsg_echo_linux/j722s-evm/c75ss0-0_freertos/ti-c7000
ipc_rpmsg_echo_linux/j722s-evm/c75ss1-0_freertos/ti-c7000
ipc_rpmsg_echo_linux/j722s-evm/main-r5fss0-0_freertos/ti-arm-clang
ipc_rpmsg_echo_linux/j722s-evm/mcu-r5fss0-0_freertos/ti-arm-clang
hello_world/j722s-evm/mcu-r5fss0-0_freertos/ti-arm-clang
"
```

### 1.4. Configure peripherals with SysConfig

The project's peripheral configurations (GPIO, I2C, UART, etc.) are defined in the `.syscfg` file.

To add new peripherals or modify existing Pin Mux settings, use the SysConfig GUI tool. To launch SysConfig for an MCU project:

- Set the `SYSCONFIG_TARGET` variable to your target project.
   - You can either edit this variable directly in the `.env` file, or
   - Pass it as an environment variable to the `task` program.

```bash
SYSCONFIG_TARGET=hello_world/j722s-evm/mcu-r5fss0-0_freertos/ti-arm-clang task sysconfig
```

After saving your changes with the `Ctrl + S` shortcut, you can close the SysConfig interface.

<Warning>
The remoteproc infrastructure is used to enable remote software loading onto R5F and C7x cores from Linux. For a
compiled `.out` file to be loadable via remoteproc, certain configurations must be set in the SysConfig interface. After
copying a new project, follow these steps:

1. Open the `IPC` tab under `TI DRIVERS`.
2. Click the `ADD` button.
3. Ensure the `Linux A53 IPC RP Message` setting is enabled.
4. Save the `.syscfg` file with `Ctrl + S` and exit.
</Warning>

### 1.5. Compile the project

```bash
ubuntu@host:examples$ PROJECT=mcu task clean build
```

### 1.6. Upload compiled project into the development board

```bash
ubuntu@host:examples$ scp mcu/hello_world/j722s-evm/mcu-r5fss0-0_freertos/ti-arm-clang/hello_world.release.out gemstone@10.0.0.1:
```

### 1.7. Run the compiled project

For loading `.out` files onto cores via remoteproc, the firmware files must be copied to `/lib/firmware` with specific predefined names. The firmware naming convention for each core is shown in the table below:

| Core          | Firmware Name        |
|---------------|----------------------|
| mcu-r5fss0-0  | j722s-mcu-r5f0_0-fw  |
| main-r5fss0-0 | j722s-main-r5f0_0-fw |
| c7xss0-0      | j722s-c71_0-fw       |
| c7xss1-0      | j722s-c71_1-fw       |

To verify firmware names and their corresponding remoteproc devices, use `head /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc*/firmware` command.
After each boot, cores may be assigned to different remoteproc devices, so this verification step is essential for proper operation.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ head /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc*/firmware
# ==> /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc0/firmware <==
# j722s-mcu-r5f0_0-fw
#
# ==> /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc1/firmware <==
# j722s-main-r5f0_0-fw
#
# ==> /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc2/firmware <==
# j722s-c71_0-fw
#
# ==> /sys/class/remoteproc/remoteproc3/firmware <==
# j722s-c71_1-fw
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo stop | sudo tee /sys/class/remoteproc0/state
# [ 1920.592397] remoteproc remoteproc0: stopped remote processor 79000000.r5f
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo cp hello_world.release.out /lib/firmware/j722s-mcu-r5f0_0-fw
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo start | sudo tee /sys/class/remoteproc0/state
# [ 1928.127331] remoteproc remoteproc0: powering up 79000000.r5f
# [ 1928.133194] remoteproc remoteproc0: Booting fw image j722s-mcu-r5f0_0-fw, size 45492
# [ 1928.173034] remoteproc remoteproc0: remote processor 79000000.r5f is now up
```

<Warning>
The above procedure ensures graceful shutdown and restart of remote cores. In some cases, the graceful shutdown process may fail. If this occurs, we recommend:

1. Place new firmware binaries in `/lib/firmware`.
2. Perform a full board reboot.

During system startup, remoteproc will automatically load the firmware to the appropriate cores.

**Note:** This approach is particularly useful when:

- Core crashes occur
- IPC communication fails
- Unexpected behavior is observed during dynamic loading
</Warning>

## 2. Boot Diagram

The flow chart specified below is for the Gemstone Obsidian development board, but a similar structure is found in many
ARM-based embedded Linux development boards.

<SnippetBootflow/>

### 2.1. ROM Bootloader (RBL)

The RBL (ROM Bootloader), often distributed by manufacturers only as compiled programs without source code, has the
primary purpose of performing hardware health checks and initialization tasks when the board is first powered on, and
then transitioning to the SBL (Secondary Bootloader), whose source code can be modified. The location from which the SBL
is read and started is determined by the RBL through boot mode switches.

### 2.2. Secondary Bootloader (SBL)

The purpose of the Secondary Boot Loader on the _T3-GEM-O1_ development boards is to launch the more advanced bootloader
called U-Boot and to enable writing images to
[eMMC](https://github.com/t3gemstone/texas-am67-sbl-gemboot/blob/main/main.c#L319) via the Gemstone Imager application.

In embedded boards containing Linux Kernel, U-Boot is often preferred. While pre-bootloaders like SBL can perform basic
initialization tasks, U-Boot has much more advanced features. For example, U-Boot has its own Terminal/Console interface
and supports many drivers not available in SBL, enabling more sophisticated customizations.

### 2.3. U-Boot

After the SBL, U-Boot takes control of the development board. Based on the configurations defined in the 
[Device Tree](../../../faq#device-tree-nedir), it activates the relevant hardware drivers, executes a set of predefined
commands to load components like the Linux Kernel and Initrd into RAM, and then transfers control to the Linux Kernel.

#### 2.3.1. U-Boot Console Exercises

<Tip>
This section demonstrates the use of the U-Boot console by connecting to the Gemstone development board via TTL. You can
quickly review the documents below.

</Tip>

</Frame>

### 2.4. Linux Kernel

It loads the drivers for the hardware defined in the [Device Tree](../../../faq#device-tree-nedir). Then, if present, it
starts the initrd/initramfs and executes the `init` program located in the rootfs.

<Tip>
The device tree files for U-Boot and the Linux kernel are different. In U-Boot, the device tree typically only
activates enough hardware to load the kernel and initramfs into RAM from various storage devices (MMC, SSD, SPI flash,
...). The actual hardware activation is performed by the kernel.
</Tip>

### 2.5. Initial RAM Disk (Initrd)

A temporary filesystem located in RAM that performs intermediate tasks such as loading kernel modules, decrypting disks,
and performing software updates before the rootfs is started.

<Tip>
If the rootfs is stored encrypted on the disk, the kernel cannot directly start the `init` program. First, the disk
encryption must be decrypted by the initramfs.
</Tip>

### 2.6. Root Filesystem (Rootfs)

After completing its tasks, the initrd mounts the rootfs—a filesystem containing system and user programs, libraries,
and various configuration files—to the `/` directory. The kernel then executes the `init` program located in `/init`,
`/sbin/init`, or a similar directory in the rootfs. This program loads drivers for certain hardware (kernel modules),
starts system services (such as network connectivity, time synchronization, package updates, and Bluetooth services),
and launches the desktop environment (gnome, kde, xfce, ...).
