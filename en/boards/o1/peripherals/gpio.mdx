<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will have learned about GPIO usage on the Gemstone development board.
</Tip>

GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) refers to pins on microcontrollers and development boards that can be used 
for general-purpose input and output operations. These pins can be configured to either receive digital data (input) 
or send digital signals (output). Below is an example of an LED blink operation performed using the GPIO pins on the Gemstone board.

In addition to the materials listed on the [Quick Start](/en/quickstart) page, you will need an LED, a button, and a resistor.

### Blinking an LED

On the Gemstone board, GPIOX can be used as an Input/Output pin. Connect the LED as shown below.

</Frame>

Once the connections are complete, write and execute a script to blink the LED.

* Create the script file:

```bash
touch led_blink.sh
```

* Open the led_blink.sh file using the `nano` editor.

```bash
nano led_blink.sh
```

* Copy and paste the following code into the `led_blink.sh` file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while :
do
      gpioset $(gpiofind GPIOX)=1
      sleep 1
      gpioset $(gpiofind GPIOX)=0
      sleep 1
done
```

* Press `CTRL+X`, then press `Y` to save and exit the nano editor.

* Use the `chmod` command to make the `led_blink.sh` file executable:
```bash
chmod +x led_blink.sh
```

* Run the `led_blink.sh` script.
```bash
./led_blink.sh
```

As a result, you will see the LED blinking at 1-second intervals, as shown in the video below.

### LED Control with Button

The GPIOX pin on the Gemstone board can be used as an Input/Output for the LED, 
while the GPIOY pin can be connected to a button as shown below.

  <img height="200" width="200" src="/images/under-construction.png" />
</Frame>

After completing the connections, write and execute a script to control the 
LED based on the button state.

* Create the script file.
```bash
touch butyon_led.sh
```

* Open the `button_led.sh` file using the `nano` editor
```bash
nano button_led.sh
```

* Copy and paste the following code into the `button_led.sh` file.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

while :
do
   if (( $(gpioget --bias=pull-up $(gpiofind GPIOY)) == 0))
   then
      gpioset $(gpiofind GPIOX)=1
   else
      gpioset $(gpiofind GPIOX)=0
   fi
done
```

* Press `CTRL+X`, then `Y` to save and exit the nano editor.

* Make the `button_led.sh` file executable using the `chmod` command.

```bash
chmod +x button_led.sh
```

* Run the `button_led.sh` script.

```bash
./button_led.sh
```

As a result, you will see that the LED turns on while the button is pressed, 
as demonstrated in the video below.
