<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will have learned about serial port usage on the Gemstone development board.
</Tip>

The serial port is a simple yet effective communication method that enables data transmission between devices 
such as computers and microcontrollers. This communication typically occurs via the `UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)` 
protocol and is used for low-speed data transfer.

To better understand this communication protocol, we will demonstrate how to establish communication between a Gemstone development board 
and a Linux system using a `USB-TTL UART converter`.

### Serial Port Communication

As explained in the [Image Writing Process](/en/quickstart#1-2-image-writing-process) section of the [Quick Start](/en/quickstart) guide, 
ensure you have successfully flashed the `Minimal` image onto the Gemstone board. Connect the GPIO14 and GPIO15 (UART1) pins using the 
USB-TTL UART converter. Then, follow the steps in the [Exploring Gemstone](/en/quickstart#2-exploring-gemstone) section to log in to the 
Gemstone OS command line via SSH.

* Install `picocom`, a minimal terminal program, using the following command.
```bash
sudo apt install picocom
```

* Create a script file for serial port communication.
```bash
touch serial_test.sh
```

* Open the `serial_test.sh` file using the `nano` editor.
```bash
nano serial_test.sh
```

* Copy and paste the following code into the `serial_test.sh` file.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

SERIAL_PORT="/dev/ttyS3"
BAUD_RATE="115200"

nohup picocom -b $BAUD_RATE $SERIAL_PORT &

while true; do
    echo -n "Teknofest" > $SERIAL_PORT
    sleep 1
done
```

* Press `CTRL+X`, then `Y` to save and exit the nano editor.

* Make the `serial_test.sh` file executable using the `chmod` command.
```bash
chmod +x serial_test.sh
```

<Note> The USB-TTL UART converter connected to GPIO14 and GPIO15 
creates the `/dev/ttyS3` device in the Gemstone OS. </Note>

* On the user's computer, open the corresponding serial port in `Tabby.sh`, 
the terminal application described in the [Terminal/Console Application](/en/quickstart#2-1-1-terminal%2Fconsole-application) section.

* Run the script with `./serial_test.sh` to verify the communication.
