Computers use a hardware component called RTC (Real-Time Clock), which is powered by an external battery,
to continue counting the system time during power outages or when the system is turned off and on.

<Note>
  The T3-GEM-O1 board includes an RTC. If you do not use the RTC module, the system time will reset and start
  from 01/01/1970 when you cut and restore power to the board. If the board is connected to the internet,
  the correct time will be set after a while. If you want the time to remain accurate even without internet,
  you must use the RTC.
</Note>

### Steps to Run the RTC

<Steps>

  <Step title="Connect the Battery">

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the Current Date and Time Information">
  Next, open a terminal via [serial port](../../../quickstart#2-1-serial-port) or 
  [SSH](../../../quickstart#2-3-connecting-via-ssh-over-network). You must send your system time to the 
  RTC module once using the following command.

  ```bash
  gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo hwclock -w -u /dev/rtc0
  ```

  If the operation is successful, when you run the `hwclock -r` command, you should see an output similar to the following.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash Command
  gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo hwclock -r
  ```

  ```bash Output
  2025-07-16 08:25:02.160359+03:00
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
  Turn off your board using the power button on the board or the `poweroff` command, and unplug the power cable.
  After waiting about 10 seconds, power the board back on and run the `date` command. If the displayed date and time
  are correct, the RTC is working properly.
