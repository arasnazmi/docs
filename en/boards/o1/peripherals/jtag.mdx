JTAG (Joint Action Test Group) is a standard developed for operations such as testing connections in electronic
circuits, programming onboard storage devices, or step-by-step debugging. The board includes a single JTAG
interface connector. Debugging the dual-core R5 applications on the T3-GEM-O1 development board is performed using JTAG.

To perform debugging, the following requirements are needed:

- 1 x `T3-GEM-O1 JTAG Cable`
- A computer with `Code Composer Studio` installed,
- A JTAG debugger supported by Code Composer Studio.

In this guide, the [Texas Instruments XDS200 USB Debug Probe](https://www.ti.com/tool/TMDSEMU200-U) was used.

## JTAG Configuration and Connecting to the SOC

- Set the development board to `Dev Bootmode` as shown [here](/en/quickstart#1-3-bootmode-switch), then power it on.
  Next, connect the `T3-GEM-O1 JTAG Cable` to the board as shown in the image.

- Launch the `Code Composer Studio` program and select a new workspace directory. In this example, a workspace 
  named `tutorial_ws` was created. After selecting the workspace, the `Getting Started` screen will appear.
- On this screen, click `View -> Target Configurations`. In the opened menu, click the `New Target Configuration File` 
  button in the top-right corner to open the new configuration screen. Enter the configuration name 
  as `t3-gem-o1-am67a-debug.ccxml` and then click the `Finish` button.
- You will now see the configuration settings screen. Here, select your debugger from the `Connection` dropdown 
  menu (In this case, `Texas Instruments XDS2xx USB Debug Probe` was selected).
- Type **J722S** in the `Board or Device` filter field and check the box for the `J722S_TDA4VEN_TDA4AEN_AM67` device. 
  Then, click the `Save` button on the right to save the settings and test the debugger connection using 
  the `Test Connection` button.
- When the created configuration is executed from the `Target Configurations` screen, the connection with the
  development board will be established. From this stage onward, you can connect to the cores and load code.
