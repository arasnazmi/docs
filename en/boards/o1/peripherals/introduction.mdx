description: 'Components, Peripherals and Usage Examples'
---

In this section, examples will be provided on the usage of the sensors and data lines on the board.
Since all examples will be performed via the Terminal/Console by establishing a serial port connection,
it is assumed that you have read the explanations about Terminal usage in the [Quick Start](../../../quickstart) section.
You may choose one of the connection methods described in the relevant part, such as connecting to the Desktop image via a browser,
connecting via SSH/Ethernet, or connecting via the console over a serial port.

### Pinout

The **40-pin expansion header** on the board provides Input/Output (I/O) pins that support interfaces such as UART (serial port), I2C, SPI, PWM, and PCM.

In this section, we will discuss the purposes of the 40-pin I/O ports and which interfaces they are assigned to in the default configuration. In the next section, we will explain how these pins can be reconfigured for different uses via **Device Tree Overlay** files.

For example, the pin labeled `GPIO-7` is configured as `SPI-MCU0 CS1` by default, but it can be reassigned to UART-WKUP0 RX by enabling a **Device Tree Overlay** file. Similarly, in the Gemstone VTOL project, since Bluetooth functionality was not needed, the relevant pins were disabled and repurposed as `UART-MAIN6`.

#### UART-MAIN1

This UART interface can be accessed via the `/dev/ttyS3` device on the Gemstone card.

To test the UART line from the command line, you can use the `picocom` program.
`picocom` is a serial terminal application that instantly sends characters typed on the keyboard to the specified serial port
while also displaying data received from the other end.
After connecting the `TX` and `RX` pins with a jumper cable,
you can run the following command. If the connections are correct, you should see the characters you type in real time on your screen.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyS3
# picocom v3.1
#
# port is        : /dev/ttyS6
# flowcontrol    : none
# baudrate is    : 115200
# parity is      : none
# databits are   : 8
# stopbits are   : 1
# escape is      : C-a
# local echo is  : no
# noinit is      : no
# noreset is     : no
# hangup is      : no
# nolock is      : no
# send_cmd is    : sz -vv
# receive_cmd is : rz -vv -E
# imap is        :
# omap is        :
# emap is        : crcrlf,delbs,
# logfile is     : none
# initstring     : none
# exit_after is  : not set
# exit is        : no
#
# Type [C-a] [C-h] to see available commands
# Terminal ready
# Hello World
```

#### I2C-MCU0

This I2C interface can be accessed via the `/dev/i2c-1` device on the Gemstone card.

To view the peripherals connected to the bus, you can use the `i2cdetect` command.
An example output is provided below.
In the command output, peripherals marked with `UU` at addresses (`0x30`) are connected to the I2C bus but are currently in use by the Linux kernel,
while peripherals with a direct address number (`0x6b`) are connected to the I2C bus and available for use.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ i2cdetect -r -y 1
#      0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
# 00:                         -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
# 10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
# 20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
# 30: UU -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
# 40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
# 50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
# 60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 6b -- -- -- --
# 70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
```

#### I2C-WKUP0

<Warning>
This I2C interface is used to detect **Hardware Attached on Top (HAT)** devices connected via the **40-pin expansion header**.
During boot, the EEPROM on the HAT is queried, and the device information is read. If no HAT will be connected to the board,
these pins should be left unconnected.
</Warning>

#### SPI-MCU0

This SPI interface can be accessed via the `/dev/spidev0.0` and `/dev/spidev0.1` devices on the Gemstone card.
The `/dev/spidev0.0` device corresponds to SPI-MCU0 CS0, while `/dev/spidev0.1` corresponds to SPI-MCU0 CS1.

To test the SPI line from the command line, you can use the `spi-pipe` program.
The `spi-pipe` program sends data from stdin to the SPI line specified by the `--device` parameter and outputs the received data to stdout.

After connecting the `MOSI` and `MISO` pins with a jumper cable,
you can execute the following command. If the connections are correct, you should see the text "Hello World" on your screen.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ printf '\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f\x20\x57\x6f\x72\x6c\x64' | spi-pipe --device /dev/spidev0.0 --speed 1000000
# Hello World
```

#### PWM-1B

This PWM interface can be accessed via the `/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip5/pwm1` device on the Gemstone card.

For this device to be created, the `export` command must first be executed.
Then, the `period` and `duty_cycle` values (in nanoseconds) should be set to the desired values as shown in the example below.
After enabling the device with the `enable` command, the PWM output can be obtained.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip5/export
# 1
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 2000000 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip5/pwm1/period     # 500 Hz
# 2000000
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 1000000 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip5/pwm1/duty_cycle # 50%
# 1000000
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip5/pwm1/enable
# 1
```

#### PWM-ECAP0

This PWM interface can be accessed via the `/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0` device on the Gemstone card.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/export
# 0
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 2000000 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/period     # 500 Hz
# 2000000
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 1000000 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/duty_cycle # 50%
# 1000000
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/pwm0/enable
# 1
```

#### PCM-McASP0

Pulse-code Modulation (PCM), known as Multichannel Audio Serial Port (McASP) in Texas Instruments SoCs, can be used in real-time audio processing applications requiring low-latency and high-quality digital audio streaming.
The `FS` pin provides frame-sync signals to external audio devices like DACs, while the `CLK` pin similarly supplies clock signals.
Through the `DIN` pin, data input can be received from digital audio devices such as I2S microphones, and via the `DOUT` pin, data output can be sent to digital audio devices like DACs.
