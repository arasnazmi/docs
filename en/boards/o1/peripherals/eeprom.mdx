<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will be informed about the technical specifications, usage areas, and various usage methods of the EEPROM allocated to the user on the board. 
</Tip>

EEPROMs are generally used to store hardware or software parameters that can be configured on the board, specific information about the board (product type, product serial number, etc.), or firmware (BIOS, etc.) due to reasons such as not containing a file system, being immediately 
accessible during boot, and being able  to retain written data without corruption for many years. 

<Note>
While SD cards and USB flash drives can retain stored data without corruption for up to 10 years, the AT24C512C model EEPROM can retain data without corruption for 40 years. 
</Note>

## EEPROM Usage

There is a 512-Kbit (equivalent to 64KiB) EEPROM with the AT24C512C model on the board. It is connected to the SOC via the I2C line. The necessary drivers for use on Linux come pre-installed. It is defined in the Linux device tree as follows:

```c++
&wkup_i2c0 {
  ...

	eeprom@51 {
		compatible = "atmel,24c512";
		reg = <0x51>;
	};

  ...

}
```
After connecting to the board's terminal, when the following command is executed, we should see the folder named `2-0051`.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ ls /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/at24/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root    0 Apr  7  2022 ./
drwxr-xr-x 66 root root    0 Apr  7  2022 ../
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    0 Jul  9 14:35 2-0051 -> '../../../../devices/platform/bus@f0000/bus@f0000:bus@b00000/2b200000.i2c/i2c-2/2-0051'/
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    0 Jul  9 14:35 module -> ../../../../module/at24/
--w-------  1 root root 4.0K Jul  9 14:35 bind
--w-------  1 root root 4.0K Apr  7  2022 uevent
--w-------  1 root root 4.0K Jul  9 14:35 unbind
```

<Note>
The `2` in the folder name indicates that the EEPROM is on the 2nd I2C line (i.e., wkup_i2c0), and `0051` indicates that the I2C address is 0x51.
</Note>

When we examine the files found under this folder, we should see a file named `eeprom`.This file is produced by the `at24` driver and allows us to read and write to the EEPROM as if it were a normal file.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ ls /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/at24/2-0051/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root    0 Apr  7  2022 ./
drwxr-xr-x 7 root root    0 Apr  7  2022 ../

```

## Using EEPROM via Terminal

Let's completely clear the EEPROM with the following command.

<Note>
Since the EEPROM used in the T3-GEM-O1 board is 512 kilobits (64KiB), the count (number of bytes to be written) is set to 65536 (64 x 1024).
</Note>

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/at24/2-0051/eeprom bs=1 count=65536 status=progress
[sudo] password for gemstone: 
65493 bytes (65 kB, 64 KiB) copied, 356 s, 0.2 kB/s
65536+0 records in
65536+0 records out
65536 bytes (66 kB, 64 KiB) copied, 356.235 s, 0.2 kB/s
```

<Note>
As seen from the `dd` output, the EEPROM write speed is `0.2 kB/s`, meaning we can write 200 bytes per second. One disadvantage of EEPROMs is their very low write speeds.
</Note>

We can write data to the EEPROM with the following command.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ echo "Gemstone EEPROM" | sudo tee /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/at24/2-0051/eeprom
[sudo] password for gemstone: 
Gemstone EEPROM
```

For reading, the following command can be executed.

```bash
gemstone@t3-gem-o1:~$ sudo cat /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/at24/2-0051/eeprom
Gemstone EEPROM
```

We can read and write data to the EEPROM as if we are reading and writing from a normal text file, using any programming language. Below are usage examples in Python and C. The only thing to pay attention to here is that we need to select the write mode for writing. EEPROMs do not support hybrid write modes like `"w+"`, `"r+"`, etc.

    fclose(eeprom);
    
    // Oku
    eeprom = fopen(eeprom_path, "r");
    fread(eeprom_buffer, 1, eeprom_size, eeprom);
    printf("eeprom veri: %s\n", eeprom_buffer);
    fclose(eeprom);
    
    return 0;
}
