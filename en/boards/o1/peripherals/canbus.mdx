<Tip>
By the end of this section, you will learn how to create a virtual CAN interface on the Gemstone development board.
</Tip>

The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a widely used communication standard, particularly in automotive and 
industrial automation applications. The CAN protocol stands out for its high reliability and low-cost data transmission advantages.

### Using CAN Bus

The Gemstone OS allows creating a virtual CAN interface, enabling data communication without requiring additional hardware.

<Note> Since this example requires multiple terminals, using the `Desktop OS image` is recommended.</Note>

* After connecting to the Gemstone OS, install the `kernel-module-vcan-6.1.83-ti` module to enable virtual CAN support.

```bash
sudo apt install picocom kernel-module-vcan-6.1.83-ti
```
* Activate the module using `modprobe`.

```bash
sudo modprobe vcan
```
* Create and configure the virtual CAN interface (vcan0) with the following commands.

```bash
sudo ip link add dev vcan0 type vcan
sudo ip link set up vcan0
```

* Create a test script (can_test.sh) and open it for editing.

```bash
touch can_test.sh
nano can_test.sh
```

* Copy and paste the following script, then save and exit.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

while :
do
   cansend vcan0 123#AABBCCDDEE112233
   sleep 1
done
```

* Install `can-utils` for CAN packet transmission/reception commands (cansend, candump, etc.).

```bash
sudo apt install can-utils
```

To test communication:

1. Open two terminals

2. In the first terminal, monitor CAN traffic with:
```bash
candump vcan0
```

3. In the second terminal, run the test script.
```bash
./can_test.sh
```
