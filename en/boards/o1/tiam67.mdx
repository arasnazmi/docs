The Gemstone Obsidian (_T3-GEM-O1_) model uses the Texas Instruments AM67A microprocessor. 
This System on Chip (SoC) integrates a quad-core ARM Cortex速-A53 and dual-core Cortex速-R5. 
This means you can run operating systems like Linux on the A53 cores while simultaneously 
running MCU projects (Baremetal, FreeRTOS, Zephyr RTOS) on the Cortex速-R5 cores.

<Tip>For example, you can develop ROS2, OpenCV, C++, Python projects on the A53 with Gemstone Linux, 
while writing MCU applications on the R5 cores that handle system safety and control.</Tip>

The AM67A model features a dual-core C7x DSP chip that serves as a hardware accelerator 
for deep learning. The image below shows some key features of this SoC.

For developing MCU software to run on the Cortex速-R5 cores, Texas Instruments' 
CCS Code Composer Studio is used. The table below lists the most commonly used resources 
for this microprocessor.

<Warning>Some of the capabilities and features listed for AM67A on the manufacturer's website 
are not yet available. Due to insufficient documentation and support, users must research 
and solve these limitations through trial and error. For example, while Network Bootmode 
is mentioned for AM67A, no documentation or sample code has been provided.</Warning>

<Check>The T3 Foundation Gemstone Community is working to address these limitations 
for the Gemstone development board, with updates being published to Github repositories.</Check>

Since Texas Instruments hasn't released a stable MCU SDK or complete documentation for this model, 
development often references the Jacinto product line. The [Components](./boards/o1/peripherals/mcu) 
section explains how to compile and run an MCU application on Gemstone boards. 
For feedback and suggestions, please use the [Gemstone Community Forums](https://community.t3gemstone.org/).
